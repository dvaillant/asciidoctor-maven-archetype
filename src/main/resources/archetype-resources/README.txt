README.txt

To build the demo document, type "mvn install". This will generate 'document.pdf'
in this directory based on the asciidoc source located in src/doc/asciidoc/.

This document shows some example of asciidoc features and explains how to start
customizing this demo.

Note: as this example relies on version 0.1.4 of the asciidoctor maven plugin,
   it might be necessary to compile it after cloning it from github.
